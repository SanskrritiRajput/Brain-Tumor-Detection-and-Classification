# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification
By Sanskriti Rajput


This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images into four categories:
- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma Tumor
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
Brain Tumor MRI dataset taken from Kaggle.

Note: Dataset is not included in this repository due to size limitations.
Link to dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri

## Model Description
A deep CNN model with multiple convolution, pooling, and dropout layers is used to extract features from MRI images and perform multi-class classification.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries
2. Update dataset paths in the code
3. Run the Python script

## Purpose
This project was developed for learning and academic purposes in the field of Deep Learning and Medical Image Analysis.
